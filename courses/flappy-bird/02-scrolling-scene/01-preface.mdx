# Preface

With the canvas setup, let’s start by rendering the sky background and the scrolling ground along the bottom.

Here's a list of what we'll cover to accomplish this:

- 🎯 A helper to load images
- 🎯 A class to represent data such as position
- 🎯 A class to represent a sub-image of the sprite sheet
- 🎯 A class to manage the the ground scroll and drawing
- 🎯 A game loop to update the position of the ground per frame
- 🎯 A sprite lookup to tell us _where_ to pull sprites from the sprite sheet
