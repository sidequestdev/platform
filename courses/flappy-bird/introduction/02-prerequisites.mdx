# Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's talk about a few prerequisites we have:

- We assume you are familiar with web development
  - You could spin up a React app using `create-react-app`, or similar in other frameworks
  - This doesn't mean you're a CSS wizard
  - Tooling like prettier, eslint, etc aren't totally new to you
- Testing with a library like [Jest](https://jestjs.io) sounds good
  - This will become more relvevant in the Entity Component System portion of the course
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is not new to you
  - You don't need to be a generics sorcerer, we'll breakdown any complex types we write in the course
- Setting up visual studio code on your own isn't a big deal
- You can install a package like nodejs on your own
- Using a tool like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) does not scare you

If you're adventurous, don't let this list stop you from going out on your own to use Google-fu to learn more along the way. This is just a rough list.
