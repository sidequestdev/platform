# Preface

Now that we've taken care of the background and scrolling ground, we'll tackle the bird next. We'll need:

- 🎯 To animate the bird's flap animation
- 🎯 To apply gravity every frame
- 🎯 To support mouse click on the canvas to make the bird "flap"
- 🎯 To rotate the bird correctly based on current speed
- 🎯 Add some state to the bird to support _click to start_ when the game first loads
