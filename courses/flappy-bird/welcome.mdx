# Welcome

In this course we're going to recreate the game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) from scratch. We'll leverage the `<canvas>` element, some free [assets](https://megacrash.itch.io/flappy-bird-assets) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to create the game.
