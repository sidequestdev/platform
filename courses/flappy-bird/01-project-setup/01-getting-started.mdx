# Getting Started

## Node Version

We're using Node.js version `16` for this course. We've also included an `.nvmrc` file for version managers in the root of the project.

## Clone the Starter Project

To get started we'll pull down the starter project by running:

`npx degit sidequestdev/flappy-bird-course-starter flappy-bird`

<AlertInfo title="NPX">
  You can learn more about npx by visiting the
  [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx).
</AlertInfo>

Feel free to change the `flappy-bird` to something else if you'd like, but we'll use that directory name where relevant.

Then `cd flappy-bird` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You should see a black canvas centered in the page.

## Vite

This project will be powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). We believe it's an excellent tool for building web apps, with a lot of good defaults.

Why are we using Vite:

- Static asset handling:
  - `import imageUrl from './assets/images/image.png'`
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Super fast

## What's Already Included

We provide a `div#container` element that already contains a `<canvas>` tag. This leverages a small amount of CSS found in `styles.css` to position the canvas in the center of the screen and set it's background color to black.

There are a number of config files for common tooling (eslint, prettier, npm, etc) that we've provided for you as well.

The sprite sheet we'll use is located in `assets/images/spritesheet.png`. It is a single image we'll use to draw every asset in the game.

An important file we've included is `src/sprite-map.ts`. It holds the sub-image information used to sample (take a piece of) sections of the larger sprite sheet. Don't worry about the details of this file just yet, we'll demonstrate it's usage later.

## Things to Note

- We are targeting a modern version of Chrome - 97+, if the game works in other browsers, sweet!
